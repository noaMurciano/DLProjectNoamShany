### 4.3 Limitations and Challenges

#### 4.3.1 Dataset Limitations

**Scale Constraints**: Our dataset of 199 samples, while sufficient for proof-of-concept, represents a minimal viable dataset for robust personal preference learning. The class imbalance (18.6% disgusting, 42.2% neutral, 39.2% tasty) reflects natural preference distributions but challenges minority class detection.

**Sample Selection Bias**: Personal labels were selected from Food101 categories, potentially missing food types that would reveal additional preference patterns. The pre-selection of "interesting" foods may not represent everyday dietary choices.

**Temporal Limitations**: Our approach captures preferences at a single time point, not accounting for how individual tastes evolve over time or vary with context (mood, health, season).

#### 4.3.2 Model Limitations

**Context Insensitivity**: The model cannot account for contextual factors that influence food preference, such as meal timing, social setting, hunger level, or health considerations.

**Visual Dependence**: Classification relies solely on visual appearance, missing crucial factors like aroma, texture, temperature, freshness, and preparation quality that significantly influence taste preference.

**Binary Decision Limitation**: The three-class formulation simplifies the nuanced spectrum of food preferences, potentially missing subtle gradations in taste appreciation.

#### 4.3.3 Generalization Challenges

**Individual Specificity**: Models trained on one person's preferences may not transfer to other individuals, limiting broader applicability without additional personalization data.

**Cultural and Demographic Bias**: Our approach focuses on one individual's preferences, potentially missing broader patterns that could inform population-level models or cross-cultural understanding.

**Domain Transfer**: Adaptation to new food categories or preparation styles not represented in training data remains challenging.

### 4.4 Future Research Directions

#### 4.4.1 Dataset Enhancement

**Scale and Diversity**: Future work should explore larger personal datasets (500-1000 samples) across more individuals to understand population-level patterns while maintaining personalization effectiveness.

**Longitudinal Studies**: Tracking preference changes over time would enable dynamic preference modeling and understanding of taste evolution patterns.

**Contextual Data Collection**: Incorporating contextual information (time of day, social setting, health status) could significantly improve prediction accuracy and relevance.

**Multi-modal Integration**: Combining visual data with textual descriptions, nutritional information, and sensory attributes could provide richer preference models.

#### 4.4.2 Technical Advancements

**Few-Shot Learning**: Advanced few-shot and meta-learning techniques could reduce the data requirements for effective personalization, enabling preference learning from even fewer examples.

**Active Learning**: Intelligent sample selection could optimize the labeling process, identifying the most informative images for personal preference learning.

**Attention Mechanisms**: Visual attention models could identify which aspects of food images most strongly influence personal preferences, providing interpretable insights.

**Uncertainty Quantification**: Bayesian approaches could provide principled uncertainty estimates, indicating when the model is confident vs. uncertain about predictions.

Through careful transfer learning, proper validation methodology, and comprehensive evaluation, we show that individual food preferences can be learned from limited personal data and generalized to new food images.

The comparison of validation methodologies provides valuable insights for the broader machine learning community working with small datasets. The 60/20/20 split approach, despite reducing test accuracy from 52.5% to 37.5%, offers superior methodology and improved minority class detection, highlighting the importance of proper validation even in data-limited scenarios.

Our analysis of learned preference patterns reveals that individual food taste contains structured, learnable patterns including quality appreciation, texture sensitivity, and cultural diversity. These insights suggest that personal preferences, while highly individual, are not random but follow discoverable principles that AI systems can capture and utilize.

The computational efficiency of our approach (sub-minute training) combined with reasonable model size (48MB) makes practical deployment feasible, opening possibilities for real-time personal preference adaptation in production systems.

While limitations remain—particularly around context sensitivity, temporal dynamics, and generalization across individuals—this work establishes a foundation for personal food preference modeling that can inform future research and applications.

The broader implications extend beyond food recommendation to the fundamental challenge of building AI systems that truly adapt to individual users. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, the ability to personalize models efficiently and effectively becomes crucial for user satisfaction, trust, and beneficial outcomes.

Future research directions are rich and varied, from technical improvements in few-shot learning and multi-modal integration to broader applications in health, wellness, and personalized recommendation systems. The intersection of computer vision, transfer learning, and personalization presents numerous opportunities for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

Ultimately, this work contributes to the vision of AI systems that serve individual needs while respecting personal preferences, autonomy, and privacy—a crucial direction for the beneficial development of artificial intelligence technology.
