## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Course**: 046211 Deep Learning  
**Author**: Noam Shani  
**Title**: Personal Food Taste Classification using Transfer Learning

### Objective
Develop a personalized AI system that can predict individual food taste preferences (disgusting, neutral, tasty) by fine-tuning a pre-trained Food101 classification model with personal labeled data.

---

## ðŸ§  Technical Approach

### 1. Base Model Architecture
- **Backbone**: EfficientNet-B3 (tf_efficientnet_b3)
- **Parameters**: 11,090,475 total parameters
- **Pre-training**: ImageNet weights + Food101 fine-tuning
- **Classification Head**: 
  - Global Average Pooling (1536 features)
  - Linear(1536, 256) + GELU activation
  - Dropout(0.3) for regularization
  - Linear(256, 3) for final classification

### 2. Transfer Learning Strategy

**Two-Phase Curriculum Learning:**

**Phase 1 (8 epochs): Frozen Backbone Training**
- Freeze all EfficientNet-B3 backbone parameters
- Train only the classification head
- Higher learning rate for new layers
- Focus on learning personal preference patterns

**Phase 2 (7 epochs): End-to-End Fine-tuning**
- Unfreeze backbone for full model training
- Very low learning rate for backbone preservation
- Discriminative learning rates prevent feature destruction

**Learning Rate Strategy:**
```python
head_lr = 1e-3      # Higher for new classification layers
backbone_lr = 1e-5  # Very low to preserve learned features
```

### 3. Personal Data Integration

**Dataset Specifications:**
- **Size**: 199 personally labeled food images from Food101
- **Classes**: 
  - Disgusting: 37 images (18.6%)
  - Neutral: 84 images (42.2%)  
  - Tasty: 78 images (39.2%)

**Data Challenge:**
Learning highly subjective, individual preferences from limited data while avoiding overfitting.

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Design

### 1. Validation Methodology Comparison

**Research Question**: How does train/validation/test split affect small dataset performance?

**Approach A: 80/20 Split**
- Train: 159 samples, Test: 40 samples
- No separate validation set
- Risk of test set leakage in model selection

**Approach B: 60/20/20 Split**  
- Train: 119 samples, Validation: 40 samples, Test: 40 samples
- Proper validation methodology
- Reduced training data but better model selection

### 2. Loss Function Design

**Combined Loss Function:**
```python
total_loss = cross_entropy_loss + Î» * consistency_loss
```

**Components:**
- **Cross-entropy Loss**: Primary classification objective with class weights
- **Consistency Loss**: MSE between predicted scores and original CLIP scores
- **Label Smoothing**: 0.05 to prevent overfitting on small dataset
- **Class Weights**: Inverse frequency weighting to handle imbalance

### 3. Data Augmentation Strategy

**Training Augmentations (Light):**
```python
transforms.Compose([
    transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.85, 1.0)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.3),
    transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.1, contrast=0.1, 
                          saturation=0.1, hue=0.05),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
                        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

**Validation/Test (Conservative):**
```python
transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
                        std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])
```

### 4. Early Stopping & Regularization

- **Criterion**: Validation macro F1-score plateau
- **Patience**: 5 epochs without improvement
- **Metric Choice**: Macro F1 handles class imbalance better than accuracy

### 2. Small Dataset Methodology
**Strategies for Limited Data:**
- Conservative data augmentation to prevent overfitting
- Discriminative learning rates for transfer learning
- Early stopping based on validation performance
- Class weights and weighted sampling for imbalance

### 3. Validation Methodology Study
**Research Contribution**: Rigorous comparison of data splitting strategies
- **Finding**: Proper validation crucial even with performance cost
- **Insight**: 25% less training data vs. better model selection methodology
- **Result**: Improved disgusting class detection with proper validation
