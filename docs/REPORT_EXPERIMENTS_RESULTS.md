## 3. Experiments and Results

This section presents comprehensive experimental evaluation of our personal food taste classification approach. We evaluate two data splitting strategies, analyze model performance across different metrics, and provide insights into learned personal preference patterns.

### 3.1 Dataset Description

#### 3.1.1 Personal Food Taste Dataset

Our personal dataset consists of 199 hand-labeled food images selected from the Food101 dataset, representing individual taste preferences across diverse food categories:

**Dataset Statistics:**
- **Total samples**: 199 images
- **Image source**: Food101 dataset (101 food categories)
- **Coverage**: 95 out of 101 Food101 categories represented
- **Image resolution**: 224×224 pixels (resized from original)
- **Format**: RGB color images

**Class Distribution:**
- **Disgusting** (Class 0): 37 samples (18.6%)
- **Neutral** (Class 1): 84 samples (42.2%)
- **Tasty** (Class 2): 78 samples (39.2%)

The class imbalance reflects natural preference patterns, with fewer items rated as disgusting and a tendency toward neutral or positive ratings.

#### 3.1.2 Food Category Diversity

The personal dataset spans diverse food categories including:
- **Desserts**: tiramisu, crème brûlée, ice cream, panna cotta
- **Seafood**: sashimi, tuna tartare, lobster bisque, ceviche
- **Continental**: croque madame, falafel, garlic bread
- **Fried Foods**: beignets, fried calamari
- **Soups**: miso soup, various broths
- **Main Dishes**: Various meat, vegetarian, and ethnic cuisines

This diversity ensures the model learns preferences across different food types, cooking methods, and cultural cuisines.

### 3.2 Experimental Setup

#### 3.2.1 Baseline Models

We compare our approach against several baselines:

1. **Random Classifier**: Uniform random predictions across three classes (33.3% expected accuracy)
2. **Majority Class Baseline**: Always predict most frequent class (neutral) (42.2% accuracy)
3. **Pre-trained Food101**: Original model without personal adaptation

#### 3.2.2 Splitting Strategy Comparison

We evaluate two data splitting methodologies to understand their impact on small dataset performance:

**Experiment A: 80/20 Split**
- Training: 159 samples (79.9%)
- Testing: 40 samples (20.1%)
- Validation: None (test set used for model selection)

**Experiment B: 60/20/20 Split**
- Training: 119 samples (59.8%)
- Validation: 40 samples (20.1%)
- Testing: 40 samples (20.1%)

Both splits maintain stratified sampling to preserve class distribution proportions.

#### 3.2.3 Training Configuration

**Hardware**: CUDA-compatible GPU with 8GB+ memory
**Training Time**: < 1 minute per experiment
**Reproducibility**: Fixed random seed (42) for all experiments
